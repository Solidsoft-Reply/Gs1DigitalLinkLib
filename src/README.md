This .NET library translates between GS1 element strings and GS1 Digital Link URIs. It includes reversible compression functions, as defined in the GS1 Digital Link standard. Please note the legal disclaimer that applies to all GS1 standards.

The GS1 Digital Link Library for .NET is a port of the GS1 Digital Link Compression Prototype, provided by GS1and written in JavaScript. This, in turn, is an extended version of the  GS1 Digital Link Toolkit . To differentiate our .NET (C#) code from the GS1 Digital Link Toolkit, we’ve named it the ‘GS1 Digital Link Library for .NET’, deliberately dropping the term ‘Toolkit’ to avoid any misperception regarding its relationship to the GS1 Toolkit. There is no formal relationship. However, it provides a functional superset of the GS1 Digital Link Toolkit. In addition to supporting compression and decompression, the functionality has been streamlined and extended. It is presented in a form that naturally supports common .NET idioms.
